# PAI — Personal AI Infrastructure

> **PAI 3.0 Alpha** — Under active development.

## Install

```bash
bash ~/.claude/install.sh
```

That's it. The script installs Bun (if needed), then walks you through setup:

- Your name and AI assistant name
- ElevenLabs voice configuration (optional)
- File permissions and directory structure
- Voice server startup

After the wizard finishes, activate the `pai` command and launch:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
pai
```

The `pai` command displays the PAI banner, announces your AI's startup catchphrase via voice, and launches Claude Code with full PAI infrastructure.
