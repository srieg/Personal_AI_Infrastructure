## What Are Releases?

Releases are **complete `.claude/` directories** ready to drop into your home folder. Each release contains everything you need: skills, hooks, workflows, memory structure, and configuration.

This is the fastest way to get PAI running. Copy the directory, run the wizard, restart Claude Code.

> **Note:** The `.claude` directory is hidden by default on macOS/Linux. Use `ls -la` to see it.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI.git
cd PAI/Releases/v3.0

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see .claude directory?** It's hidden. Use `ls -la ~/` or press `Cmd+Shift+.` in Finder.

**Hooks not firing?** Restart Claude Code after installation.
